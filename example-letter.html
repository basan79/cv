					Throughout my professional career I have worked within the Java ecosystem, utilising various frameworks, libraries and supporting technologies. When projects have been on a smaller scale or required rapid prototyping, I have also used the Python programming language.

					In my spare time I am a free / open source software (FOSS) enthusiast who regularly attends FOSDEM conferences and other community events. You can learn more about my projects on my website at <a href="http://loomchild.net">loomchild.net</a>.
